# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Description
This is a multiple choice quiz application that has some basic coding questions to test the user's coding knowledge. The app runs in the browser and stores the user's username and score locally so that they can see their previous quiz attempts and track their progress. The user's score increases by 10 points and decreases by 5 points for correct and incorrect answers, respectively. The next button displays red or green to indicate incorrect or correct scores and once the button is clicked, the next question appears. Once all of the questions have been run through, the game is over, and the user is prompted to input their username. If the user wants to see how their score compares to previous attempts, they can click "view highscores".

Next steps for this application would be to add more basic questions, create categories to test the user's knowledge of that specific category, allow the user to add their own questions, sort the table by scores (high to low), & add a timer function.

## Usage
The user can type their daily tasks and/or reminders into the corresponding hour's textbox. Without refreshing the page, the user can write their schedule and move things around to see what their day will look like. In order for the inputted data to be saved, the corresponding hour's save button must be clicked. This information is stored locally on the user's browser to ensure that if the user exits or refreshes the page, the information won't disappear. If the user changes their mind and wants to change a task/reminder, they can delete what has been written and click the save button again.

Application functionality can be seen in the screen recording below:
